# Node.js Basics Assignment

## 1. What is Node.js and what is it used for?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code on the server side. It is used for building scalable network applications, particularly web servers.

## 2. Explain the main differences between Node.js and traditional web server environments like Apache or Nginx.
Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture, which allows it to handle many connections concurrently. Traditional web servers like Apache and Nginx use a multi-threaded approach, where each connection might be handled by a separate thread.

## 3. What is the V8 engine and how does Node.js utilize it?
The V8 engine is Google's open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. Node.js uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code on the server side.

## 4. Describe the event-driven architecture of Node.js.
Node.js operates on an event-driven architecture, where an event loop processes asynchronous callbacks. This allows Node.js to handle I/O operations without blocking the main thread.

## 5. What are some common use cases for Node.js?
- Real-time web applications (e.g., chat applications)
- RESTful APIs
- Data streaming applications
- Single-page applications
- Microservices architecture

## 6. How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?
Node.js uses non-blocking I/O and asynchronous callbacks to handle operations. This allows it to continue executing other code while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

## 7. What is the purpose of the package.json file in a Node.js project?
The `package.json` file is used to manage a project's dependencies, scripts, versioning, and metadata. It is essential for sharing the project with others and for reproducing the development environment.

## 8. Explain the role of the Node Package Manager (NPM).
NPM is a package manager for Node.js that helps in installing, updating, and managing libraries and packages used in a Node.js project.

## 9. What is the node_modules folder and why is it important?
The `node_modules` folder stores all the installed dependencies for a Node.js project. It is essential for running the project as it contains all the required libraries.

## 10. How can you check the version of Node.js and NPM installed on your system?
You can check the version of Node.js by running `node -v` and the version of NPM by running `npm -v` in the terminal.

## 11. How does Node.js handle concurrency and what are the benefits of this approach?
Node.js handles concurrency using an event loop and asynchronous callbacks. This approach allows it to manage many connections efficiently without the overhead of threading, making it lightweight and scalable.

## 12. How does Node.js handle file I/O? Provide an example of reading a file asynchronously.
Node.js handles file I/O using the fs module. Here is an example of reading a file asynchronously:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log(data);
});
```

13. **What are modules in Node.js and why are they important?**
   Modules in Node.js are reusable pieces of code that can be exported and imported into other files. They help in organizing code and managing dependencies.

14. **How do you create a module in Node.js? Provide a simple example.**
   To create a module in Node.js, you can use the `module.exports` object. Here is a simple example:

   **math.js:**
   ```javascript
   module.exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
   module.exports.subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
    ```
### `require` vs `import` Statements

In Node.js, `require` and `import` are used for importing modules:

    ```javascript
    const math = require('./math');
    console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
    ```

### Module System and module.exports in Node.js
Module Exports Shorthand:
In Node.js, module.exports is used to export variables, functions, or classes from a module. The shorthand exports can also be used, which references module.exports. For example:

```javascript
Copy code
// Exporting a function using 'exports'
exports.myFunction = () => {
    // Function logic here
};
```
### CommonJS Module System:
CommonJS is a module system used in Node.js for structuring applications. It provides require() to import modules and module.exports to export them. This system allows modular code organization and reuse.

### Importing NPM Modules:
To import a module installed via NPM in Node.js, use require() with the module name. For example:

```javascript
Copy code
const axios = require('axios');
```
### Path Module in Node.js:
The path module in Node.js provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. Example usage:


```javascript
Copy code
const path = require('path');
const fullPath = path.join(__dirname, 'folder', 'file.txt');
```
### Handling Circular Dependencies:
Circular dependencies in Node.js occur when two modules require each other. To handle this, ensure dependencies are structured to minimize circular references or refactor the code to break the circular dependency.

### Built-in Modules in Node.js:
Built-in modules are core modules included with Node.js. Examples include http, fs, path, and util. They provide functionality like creating servers, file system operations, path manipulation, and utilities respectively.

### Relative vs. Absolute Module Paths:

Relative Paths: Begin with ./ or ../ and resolve relative to the current module.
Absolute Paths: Do not begin with ./ or ../ and resolve from the root of the file system or based on Node.js module resolution rules.
HTTP Server in Node.js
Creating an HTTP Server:

```javascript
Copy code
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000/');
});
```
### Purpose of http Module:
The http module in Node.js provides functionality to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests.

### Starting HTTP Server:
Use server.listen(port) method to start the HTTP server and make it listen on a specific port.

### Sending Response to Client:
Use res.end() to send a response body and res.writeHead() to set HTTP headers.

### Request and Response Objects:
req represents the incoming request to the server, while res is the server's response to the client.

### Handling HTTP Methods:
Use conditionals (if, switch) on req.method to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

### Middleware in HTTP Server:
Middleware functions intercept requests before they reach the route handlers, allowing preprocessing of requests or responses.

### Serving Static Files:
Use express.static middleware or fs module to serve static files like HTML, CSS, and images.

### Handling Errors:
Use try-catch blocks or error handling middleware (app.use((err, req, res, next) => { ... })) to handle errors in an HTTP server.

### Implementing Routing:
Implement routing using conditional logic based on req.url to handle different paths and methods within the HTTP server.
